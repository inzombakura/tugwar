Currently a ball game where a ball can be moved across a canvas. 
All that works is that basic position handling and movement through socket.io. Basic animations on an html canvas of a ball and buttons to press.

Server: nodeJS socket.io socket handler for all clients. Keeps track of position and calculates new position and velocity
Client: completely disconnected from nodejs and server. Folder can be run seperately as a static html/js/css package.
